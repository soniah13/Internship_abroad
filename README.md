# 🌍 Internship Abroad - Capstone Project

## 🚀 Introduction

*Internship Abroad* is a web platform built to simplify and centralize the **stressful process of applying for international internships**.

The inspiration? My own journey. As a student applying for internships abroad, I found the process **frustrating, confusing, and scattered across too many platforms**. It was nothing like applying locally — and worse, not many students around me even knew it was *possible* to intern abroad.

This platform is my answer to that chaos.

**Here’s what Internship Abroad is all about:**

* Helping students realize that *yes, international internships are real and attainable.*
* Making global opportunities **visible and accessible** early enough to plan for them.
* Providing a curated list of verified internships — no need to dig through random sites.
* Breaking down the **required documents and process** so it’s crystal clear.
* And not just for students! Employers from around the world can use the platform to:
  * Post internship openings.
  * Connect with **qualified students from different countries**.
  * Access a dashboard for managing listings and applications.

## 🎯 Purpose

The project was created to **bridge the gap** between students and international internship opportunities — making the whole experience smoother, more transparent, and less overwhelming.

Whether you’re a student dreaming of going global 🌐 or an employer hunting for fresh talent worldwide 🌱 — **this is your space**.
